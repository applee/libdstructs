libdstructs
===========

Simple ANSI C Data Structures Library. This is generic data structures library
written in ANSI C. As of this moment, the implementations are not intended to
be C++ compatible or thread-safe.

The list of data structures that will be included will be those that are fairly
commonplace, including, but not limited to, linkedlists, doubly-linkedlists,
queues, vectors, and hashtables.

Graphs are not currently planned to be a part of this library and will most-
likely be implemented in their own library.
