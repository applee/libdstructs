libdstructs
===========

Simple ANSI C Data Structures Library. This is generic data structures library
written in ANSI C. As of this moment, these implementations are not intended to
be C++ compatible or thread-safe.

I found myself writing the same data structures over and over again in my
projects for school like linkedlists, queues, stacks, and hashtables. Many
times, this was born out of the restriction on not being able to use arrays in
projects. So, why not build a collection of the data structures most commonly
used and put them in a library? There are a bunch of libraries like
`libdstructs` out there. This one was built to model the basic functionality of
the
[Java Collections Framework](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/collections/overview.html) 
for ANSI C, though.

The list of data structures that will be included will be those that are fairly
commonplace, including, but not limited to, linkedlists, queues, vectors,
trees, sets, and hashtables.
