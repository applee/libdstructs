libdstructs
===========

Simple ANSI C Data Structures Library. This is generic data structures library
written in ANSI C. As of this moment, these implementations are not intended to
be C++ compatible or thread-safe.

The list of data structures that will be included will be those that are fairly
commonplace, including, but not limited to, linkedlists, queues, vectors,
trees, sets, and hashtables.

`libdstructs` data structures are designed to provide the same basic 
functionalities as the objects present in the Java Collections Framework.
