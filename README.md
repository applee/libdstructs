libdstructs
===========

Simple ANSI C Data Structures Library. This is generic data structures library
written in ANSI C. As of this moment, these implementations are not intended to
be C++ compatible or thread-safe.

The list of data structures that will be included will be those that are fairly
commonplace, including, but not limited to, linkedlists, queues, vectors,
trees, sets, and hashtables.

libdstructs data structures are designed to provide the same functionality as
the objects present in the Java Collections Framework.


__Installation__
Coming soon.


__Notes__
Graphs are not currently planned to be a part of this library. See
[libgstructs](https://github.com/bezeredi/libgstructs) for that.
